-------------------------------------MAKE-------------------------------------

• Add -k when running make to continue running even in the face of errors and it wont build targets in which dependencies got errored while making - like the whole branch gets non built
• Add -i when running make to ignore errors all of them and still do everything
• -B, --always-make {Unconditionally make all targets}
• -n {Print the commands that would be executed, but do not execute them (except in certain circumstances)}
• Add a - before a command to suppress the error
• Add a @ before a command to not print the command
• Tries the following names in order: 'GNUmakefile', 'makefile' and 'Makefile'
• Use a different name, use make -f
• $@ is an automatic variable that contains the target name
• $<: Represents the first prerequisite (dependency) of the rule.
• $^: Represents all prerequisites (dependencies) of the rule
• $?: Outputs all prerequisites newer than the target
• $*: Stem in a static pattern
• $() or ${}: variable substitution
• $$(): command substitution to execute shell commands

• SRC1   := $(wildcard src/src1/*.cpp)
  OBJS_1   := $(patsubst src/src1/%.cpp,%.o,$(SRC1))

• SRCS := main.cpp foo.cpp bar.cpp
  OBJS := $(SRCS:.cpp=.o)

• objable = $(shell grep -L "main" $(alll))
  executableable = $(filter-out $(objable), $(alll))

• .PHONY : clean
  clean:
	rm -f $(OBJS) $(MAINS)

-------------------------------------GDB-------------------------------------

• g++ myprogram.cpp 2>&1 | tee compilation.log - This way you can see errors in compilation and get them into a file also
• ASSERT : Usage: You write assert(expression);. If the expression evaluates to false, assert will:
Print an error message (including the file name and line number).
Call abort(), terminating the program.
Release Mode: When the NDEBUG macro is defined (commonly in release builds), all assert calls are disabled, so they don't affect performance or behavior.
• How to use gdb? - Compile your program with the -g compiler (g++ -g -o broken broken.cpp)
• If you put a breakpoint in a line it stops before that line
• If you put a breakpoint for a function it stops just before the first line of that function
• continue: continue to the next breakpoint
• up, down: function stack
• Examples
	break bug.c:Compute(int) - Puts a breakpoint for function named Compute in a file named bug.c which takes int args
	break 26 - Puts a breakpoint at line 26
	info breakpoints - Gives information of all the break points
	delete 2 - Delete breakpoint numbered 2
	break 23 if i == count - 1  - puts breakpoint only if the condition evaluates to true
	print n - Prints value of n
	print buffer[0] = 'Z' - Changes first char of buffer to 'Z'
	info args - Gives info of all the args when you are in a function
	info locals - Gives info of all the local vars
	list - Shows 5 lines of code above and below where you are rn
	list bug.C:1 - Shows 5 lines of code above and below 1rst line of bug.c.
	step - Steps into the function one line at a time - If you at a line with a function call in it step goes into the function and then step consecutively moves one line by line
	next - Steps over the function ie executes the function and stops after it is done executing - In the above example it gets done with the function and stops after the function is done
	display x - Displays the value of x now and every time it stops
	backtrace - Shows the function call stack with their args ie what args they were called with
	up - Moves up the function stack
	down - Moves down the function stack
• Shortcuts
	break - b
	next - n
	backtrace - bt
	print - p

-------------------------------------Profiling-------------------------------------

• Profilers allow us to examine the program's overall use of system resources– focused primarily on memory use and cpu 
consumption– Can determine parts of code that are time consuming and need to be re-written for faster execution
• g++ -pg -o profile profile.cpp
• ./profile - Generates gmon.out (a binary file) {If gmon.out already exists, it will be overwritten}
  gprof profile gmon.out > analysis.txt
• Analyzing the output
	Flat profile: shows the total amount of time your program spent executing each function
	Call graph: shows how much time was spent in each function and its children can find functions that, they themselves may not have used much time, but called other functions that did!

• Objects : contain other objects, have properties and methods in them, not like a class cant use the template again later, example given above, can access the details outside 
• try, catch : throw "too many arguments";  ,  catch(err) {err.message has the string of the error}
• Classes : Shown above
• for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {}

	When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string
	Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined, the type will also be undefined
	let y = "5";let x = + y; - now x is a number
	Empty string to a numner or null to a number makes it zero
	Zero number to bool is false and "0" to bool is true

-------------------------------------GIT-------------------------------------

• working directory to local repo - checkout and commit
• local repo to origin repo - fetch and push
• pull = fetch + checkout {you will see the changes in the working directory itself without having to checkout}
• add files to staging area and then commit the changes
• .gitignore - files which you don't want git to track. Ex:- *.out, *.o, build/{this will ignore build directory in any directory inside the main}, /build/{only ignore build in main dir}
• status - tells current branch, which files in stage and are yet to commit, which are not tracked - files in gitignore wont show up
• git add .{all files in ./}, git add *.txt{all txt files}, git add -A{all changes including deletions}
• git commit{commit the staged snapshot}, git commit -a{commit modifications of all tracked files ie added to staging area at some point}, git commit --amend{change last commit}
• git commit - commits from staging area
• git commit <file> - puts the files from working dir to staging area and then commits it
• git log file1.txt - gives commit history of a file
• git log --name-only --oneline {gives the commit history in one line with only the names of files that were changed}
• git log --oneline --name-status {gives the file names along with info if they were added or modified}
• git log -p {Shows commit diffs}
• git log --graph --decorate --all {Visualizes branches and merges}
• git log --since="2025-01-01" {Shows commits after a date}
• git log --all {all commits from all branches}

• git diff HEAD {shows diff between current working dir + staged changes against last commit}
• git diff --cached <commit>, git diff <commit1> <commit2> {what should you do to commit1 to get commit2}
• git show :file1.txt {shows file1.txt as in staging area}
• git show commit:filename, git show HEAD:filename, git show <commit>
• HEAD : say where am I, normally head points to a branch and the state is the last commit, every time you commit head moves to the latest commit, detached head is when you checkout a commit and then it points to commit and not the branch
• git checkout <commit>{replace working dir with content of commit, updates head to commit, head points to a commit it says head is in detached state and commits made wont be in any branch} 
• git checkout branch {updates head to the tip of the branch, updates the working dir, and new commits will go to that branch}
• git checkout <commit> <path-to-file> {only that file is from that past commit}
• can use git restore <commit> instead of checkout, restore does not move the head
• git branch {list out the local branches}, git branch -r {list out the remote branches}, git branch -a {list all the branches}
• git checkout <commit>; git branch <new_branch>; git switch <new_branch> {creates a new branch from that state, and move to that branch}
• git switch -c <new_branch> {or} git checkout -b <new_branch> {makes the branch and switches to it} [[git switch <branch> and git checkout <branch> are same but first is newer method]]
• git branch -d <branch> {deletes the branch but doesn't if the branch is not fully merged} {use -D to force}

	let "a=1" (or) let "a=a+1"
	let is a command whose success or failure is determined by the value of expression i.e let "a=0" return non-zero exit status and vice-versa {`let a=1` also works for simple cases}
	`let a=1+3` works; `let a = 1+1` doesn't; `let "a = 1+3"` works;
	$[] {deprecated now} and $(()) {used for arithmetic ex:- a=$((3+4))} {unlike let the exit status doesn't depend on the value of expression}
	Use let when doing inline arithmetic operations that modify variables and Use $(( )) when you need arithmetic expansion and want to directly assign the result
	Bash does not support floating-point arithmetic natively; use bc (basic calculator) command instead
		By default, bc performs integer arithmetic; use -l option for float
		echo "scale=2; 5 / 2" | bc -l  ----  2.50 {default is 20 digits precision ig}
	Can use declare -i to make a variable integer-only {ex:- declare -i num=5} {if you then do num=er it will ignore it set num to zero} {if you give floating point it will round down ig}
	num=5*2+1; echo $num  ----  5*2+1

  Purpose               | Arithmetic evaluation                  | String and conditional testing
  Usage                 | Math operations and comparisons        | String comparisons, regex
  Variables             | No $ needed (e.g., ((++x)))            | $ needed for variables (e.g., [[ $x -gt 5 ]])
  String Comparison     | Not supported                          | Supports string comparison and regex
  Logical Operators     | Only basic arithmetic comparison       | Supports logical operators (&&, ||)
                        | (==, !=, >, <)                         |
  Return Value          | Numeric result (0 or non-zero)         | Boolean (true or false)

• shell variables
	$0 - script name
	$1, $2, $3 - arguments to the script
	$# - Number of arguments
	$@ - All arguments as separate words (i.e a set of strings)
	$* - All arguments as a single string (i.e. one string)
	$? - Exit status of the last command (0 = success, nonzero = failure)
	$$ - Process ID (PID) of the current shell
	$_ - Last argument of the last command {echo hello world, echo "hello world" - last arguments are "world" and "hello world" respectively}
• Functions : bash functions accept arguments just like scripts {$*, $#, $1, $2… (no explicit arguments)}, do not return values in usual way{Use echo to return output, Use return for exit codes
----greet() {
        echo "Hello, $1!"
    }  #We can get the function output as `myString=$(greet "Alice")` or by just calling greet "Alice" you can get it to the terminal
----factorial() {
        if [[ $1 -le 1 ]]; then
            echo 1
        else
            local temp=$(( $1 - 1 ))
            local result=$(factorial "$temp")
            echo $(( $1 * result ))
        fi
    }  #Can do recursive functions as well
----Default is exit code 0 i.e return 0, for errors you put return values {exit 1:Terminates the entire shell process or script, return 1 : exit status from that function}
    Like cpp global and local variables, declared out of any function are global, can shadow global variables by local vars and original ones come back after local goes out of scope	
    Environment variables are global - Inherited by any child shells or processes
    Global can be modified anywhere in the script, global declared without the keyword local
    Exported Variables: Declared using export to make them available to child processes (subshells)– Useful when running another script or program from the current scrip {`export X="hello"`}
----functt() {
	a=9
	echo $a # 9
	local a=2 #shadows the global till it goes out of scope
	echo $a # 2
    }
    echo $a # 9
• file reading
	Method 1 - res=`cat file.txt`; cat "${res}"
	Method 2 - val=$(<file.txt); echo "$val"
	Method 3 - 
		read: This is a built-in command that reads a line from standard input; In this case, from the file specified by redirection at the end
		
                file='file.txt'
                i=1  
                if [ -f "$file" ]; then
                    while read line; do  
                        #Reading each line  
                        echo "Line No. $i : $line"  
                        i=$((i+1))  
                    done < $file
                else
                    echo "File not found: $file"
                fi
	Method 4 - 
        	for file in $(ls); do
		    echo $file
		done
• file writing {there is some printf formatting look at it if you want I am not in the fucking mood to read formatting tools}
	#### 1. Overwrite the file using cat <<EOF
	cat <<EOF > "$FILE"
	This is the first line.
	This is the second line.
	EOF
	#### 2. Append more lines using cat <<EOF
	cat <<EOF >> "$FILE"
	This content is appended.
	Appending another line.
	EOF
	#### 3. `echo "This is an appended line using echo." >> "$FILE"`
	#### 4.
	while read -r line; do
    		echo "$line" >> "$FILE"
	done <<EOF
	Loop Line 1
	Loop Line 2
	Loop Line 3
	EOF
